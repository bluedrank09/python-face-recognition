# python-face-recognition
This is a Python program that can recognise the faces of the Brooklyn 99 cast in pictures. It will draw a box around their faces, label it, and then also display their high school photots in new windows. If the program doesn't recognize a face, it will make them as "Unknown"

# How To Install
1. Create a folder on your computer to store the files.
2. Clone the repository.
3. cd python-face-recognition
4. Create a virtual envirnment : python -m venv venv
5. cd venv/Scripts
6. activate
7. cd ..\..
8. pip install -r requirements.txt

# How Ro Run 
1. Get a picture of the cast either off the internet, or from the exmaples folder. The extention doesn't matter.
2. Save in python-face-recognition
3. Run the program, and give it the file name with the extention when prompted.

The program does take some time to work; from 3 to 6 minutes.
The program only works with pictures of the Brooklyn 99 cast.
To close all windows, press "q" on your computer.
If you are getting a fle off the internet, please make srue that the file is a good size = medium to large, so the program has space to work with.
